<h2>A brief summary of Gandhi's journey</h2>
<h3>Early life</h3>
<p>
Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, popularly known as Mahatma Gandhi, was born on 2nd October 1869. He was a lawyer by profession. He could have practiced law and spent a comfortable life. However, he chose to fight the British by participating in India’s struggle for freedom. He carried out various freedom movements and inspired several Indian citizens to join him. These movements had a huge impact on the British.
</p>
<h3>South Africa</h3>
<p>
Mahatma Gandhi was known for his unique ways of fighting the British. His ideologies were different from those of most freedom fighters. The British behaved cruelly with the Indians. They treated them like animals. They loaded them with work and paid them meagrely. This invoked anger in many Indians who came forward to fight the British. Filled with the feeling of hurt and anger, they took to aggressive means to drive the British officials out of the Country. However, Mahatma Gandhi chose a completely different way, thereby astonishing the others.

<h3>Return to India</h3>

<h3>India’s Independence</h3>
<p>
After a series of protests, India's independence was inevitable.
The Government of India Act (1935) surrendered significant amounts of power to Indians, and the Indian National Congress clamoured for more.
But after World War II Muslim League demanded that a separate state be created for India's Muslims, and to Gandhi's great distress, the Congress leaders agreed.
In August 1947, India was finally independent, not as a whole but divided into two countries, India and Pakistan.

<h3>Mahatma Gandhi Led Several Movements</h3>
<p>
Gandhiji initiated many freedom movements. The Dandi March, Salt Satyagrah, Non-Cooperation Movement, and Quit India Movement were among some of these movements. All these movements used non-violent means to weaken British rule. The British were perplexed by his ways and found it hard to stop him as he didn’t create any havoc or destruction.

All his movements were carried out peacefully yet had a huge impact on the British. Before participating in the freedom struggle and initiating various movements in India, Gandhiji carried out non-violent protests against colour discrimination in South Africa. He was supported by numerous people there too.

<h3>Mahatma Gandhi – A Source of Inspiration</h3>
<p>
When the Indians were filled with rage and hatred for the British and wanted to destroy them using violent methods, Gandhiji’s peaceful yet effective methodology of fighting them proved to be a source of inspiration for many. He gave speeches to inspire the Country’s youth to fight against the British. Many prominent leaders joined him and adopted his ways to attain freedom. The general public also participated in the movements led by him. He is remembered for his ideologies even today and continues to inspire numerous people.
